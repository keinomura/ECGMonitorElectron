This project was launched to create multi platform application of ECG simulation monitor

first I created ECGmonitorHTML with HTML5, JS and CSS3.
This first version Program can run only on Safari-OSX.

So this time I created New Version with Electron for OSX and Windows.


This application assumes that it works on two screens. 
Display window and operation window are displayed and constructed so that numerical change in the operation window is immediately reflected in the display window.
